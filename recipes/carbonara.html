            <p>
                There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, 
                accentuated with crisp bits of guanciale, and finished with a shower of grated aged Parmesan cheese plus freshly ground black pepper.

                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a first time, set one liter of water to boil with the salt. Once boiling, start to cook the pasta. </li>
                    <li>Dice your guanciale and fry it until crispy starting on a cold pan on <strong>low/medium heat</strong>. Once golden brown, set aside and keep the fat.</li>
                    <li>At this point, add cooking water that is twice that of the fat in the pan and set the heat on medium.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl add two egg yolks, the toasted crushed peper, and the parmesan finely grated. Mix until you get a paste-like texture.</li>
                    <li>Once your pasta is around 75% cooked, transfer them to the pan. Finish the cooking process by addind more water if necessary. 
                    There should be just <strong>enough water to cover the pasta</strong>. Once the pasta are cooked, <strong>turn off the heat</strong>. There should be a small layer of water.</li>
                    <li>Add the mix of egg yolks, parmesan, peper and stir. If there is not enough liquid to make it a cream, add a <strong>little bit</strong> of water.</li>
                    <li>Once you reached a creamy texture, add the guanciale, plate, and grate some more parmesan on top.</li>
                </ul>
